You may approach this in the modern programming language of your choice, but Python is preferred.

Attached is a json file with data on 474 youtube videos in the television and movie category.  We'd like you to do the following:

1) Assign tags as appropriate for famous actors (e.g. Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Walsh), movies (e.g. "The Hunger Games"), 
and television shows (e.g. "Game of Thrones") to each youtube video.  
[Note:  You may approach this however you choose, however, this is a very small data set and purely 
agnostic methods are unlikely to work, so we suggest you use an external source of data to identify possibly 
important actors, films and television shows and then assign them.  One source you may want to consider is 
dbpedia, http://wiki.dbpedia.org., another is omdb, http://www.omdbapi.com - you are encouraged to 
automate the fetching of this data].

2) Create your own related video algorithm: Using the information given, as well as any tags you might assign, 
create an algorithm than takes on video as input and generates three related videos from the set.  
Using your algorithm, write a file that shows the related videos for every video in the set.
